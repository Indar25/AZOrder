The **Order API** is a .NET 8 Web API that handles customer orders as part of a distributed system. It is responsible for:

- Creating, updating, and retrieving orders  
- Publishing domain events (e.g., `OrderCreatedEvent`) to RabbitMQ using MassTransit  
- Participating in the **Saga Pattern (Choreography-based)** to coordinate workflows with other services
